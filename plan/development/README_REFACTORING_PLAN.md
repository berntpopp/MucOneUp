**Target Audience:** Developers who want to understand and use MucOneUp in 60 seconds.

**Guiding Principle:** "Show, don't tell" - One perfect example is worth a thousand words.

---

## Research Summary: Modern README Best Practices (2025)

### Key Findings from Industry Standards

**From pyOpenSci Python Packaging Guide:**
- README should be **concise and scannable** - users understand the project in 30 seconds
- Include: package name, badges, 2-4 sentence explanation, quick-start example
- Installation should be **one command** when possible
- Detailed documentation belongs elsewhere (Sphinx, Read the Docs, GitHub Pages)

**From Node.js Best Practices (applicable to Python):**
- Clear project structure with separation of concerns
- Entry point should be obvious (installation → example → docs)
- Badges show project health at a glance
- Contributing and development info separate from user docs

**From Real Python/Medium Best Practices:**
- **Badges at top** - Build status, version, coverage, license
- **One perfect example** beats multiple incomplete ones
- **Core principles** section explains design philosophy
- **Links to full docs** for deep dives

- ❌ **Repetitive** - Multiple "Usage" sections, overlapping examples
- ❌ **Reference material** - Detailed CLI options belong in docs
- ❌ **No badges** - Missing build status, version, coverage indicators

**Content Issues:**
- ❌ **14 example commands** - Should be reduced to 1-2 core workflows
- ❌ **Detailed subsections** - Shell completion (39 lines), Reference installation (64 lines)
- ❌ **Embedded guides** - Migration guide, toxic protein detection, SNP integration
- ❌ **Config layout** - 100+ lines of JSON examples
- ❌ **No core principles** - Missing design philosophy statement

**Navigation Issues:**
- ❌ **Deep nesting** - Multiple levels of headings make scanning difficult
- ❌ **No quick start** - Users scroll through installation before seeing value
- ❌ **Hidden features** - Key capabilities buried in long sections
