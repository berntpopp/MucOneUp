# Trivy Ignore File
# CVE IDs listed here (one per line) will be excluded from security scans
#
# Use this for:
# - Known false positives
# - Vulnerabilities accepted as acceptable risk
# - Issues being tracked elsewhere
#
# NOTE: ignore-unfixed=true in workflow already filters unfixable vulnerabilities
# Only add CVEs here if they require explicit exclusion
#
# Example format:
# CVE-2024-12345
# CVE-2024-67890

# Add specific CVE exclusions below this line
